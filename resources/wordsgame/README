Important: These files must be UTF-8 formated.
---------  To do this, you can use gedit, oowrite or any text editor that supports UTF-8

To complete the translation, you must also provide a set of file in 
boards/wordsgame/wordslevelx.yy
Where x is the level or max and yy your target locale.
note that these words must be choosen to be simple in your language,
don't necessary translate the english. Also, it is important to make sure
that these words can be written with your keyboard in one key 
(no alt gr stuff or compose key).

GCompris will pick a file named wordslevelX.my where X is the current
level in GCompris and 'my' your locale. If X is not found, it will take
wordslevelmax.my.
It's flexible enough. The minimum number of words is around 30. No upper
limit. 
If you can, pick the words from a school children book.
