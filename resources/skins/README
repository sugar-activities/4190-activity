HOWTO make skins.

Just adding a directory here and it will be seen as a new skin to gcompris.

Then any image is selected first in the selected skin directory and if not found,
the one in the 'default' skin directory is used.

The file skin.xml must be used to specify colors and fonts for the skin.
